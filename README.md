# TriviaGame
So for this game i'm going to need to create an array with nested objects inside
to hold the data for the questions and answers.

I'm also going to need to declare variables to increment the score as well as a way to iterate through all the questions in this multiple choice test.

I will need to implement a method for the user to interact with the browser as well as a way to proof test whether or not the input is correct or not.

I would like to notify the user whether or not their answer is correct and if so, increment the variable chosen for score by 1.

Lastly i need to ensure that the activity is timed and that the game will end in the event that the given time elapses.
